AI USAGE:

I used ChatGPT with the following purposes:

-Generate hospital data (sites, practitioners, motives) quickly to mock the data and for the test.
-To gain time by generating automatically and then modifying some parts of the code, such as the generation of time slots, the state wrapper or the test.
-To try to solve the version conflicts I've encountered with Jest by asking for possible solutions to the errors.
